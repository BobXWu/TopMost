Differences from original implementations
-------------------------------------------

 1. Oringal implementations may use different optimizer settings. For simplicity and brevity, our package by default uses the same setting for different models.

This library includes some datasets for demonstration. If you are a dataset owner who wants to exclude your dataset from this library, please contact `Xiaobao Wu <xiaobao002@e.ntu.edu.sg>`_.
